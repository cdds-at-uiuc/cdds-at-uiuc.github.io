# Research questions

## How do atmospheric processes interact with ocean processes to set the pattern of tropical warming on different time scales? 

El Nino stuff..

## How does the warming pattern feed back into atmospheric clouds and circulation? 
The climate system’s response to the imposed warming is defined as feedback, which may amplify or dampen the magnitude of warming. The evolving pattern of surface warming is found to be the main driver of the varying feedback, termed as the pattern effect. Clouds, which can give both positive and negative feedback, serve as the major source of uncertainty in determining the global feedback. (concluding sentence?)
