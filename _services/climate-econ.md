# Research questions

## What are the implications of using financial asset pricing models for climate policy?

Climate-economy integrated assessment models (IAMs) are the state-of-the-art tool policymakers use to assess the benefits and costs of climate policy. Conventional IAMs generally assess the benefits and costs of climate policy within a "neoclassical growth" framework. However, such models struggle to comprehensively incoroporate risk in their policy recommendations. Recently, financial asset pricing models have been implemented to better understand how risk impacts CO<sub>2</sub> prices, but lack accurate climate emulation. We're working to update `EZClimate`, a financial asset pricing based IAM, to be in line with the sixth assessment report issued by the IPCC, including implementing a simple climate emulator in the model framework.
