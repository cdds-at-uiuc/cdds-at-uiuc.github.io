We are merging simple climate models and financial asset pricing models to assess effective approaches to climate policy.

## Implementing a simple climate model in a financial asset pricing model

**Group members involved:** Adam Bauer

Integrated assessment models (IAM) are the state-of-the-art tool for policymakers in assessing the benefits and costs of climate policy. However, until recently, IAMs lacked accurate representations of the climate system. One such IAM is `EZClimate`, a financial asset pricing model that treats CO<sub>2</sub> as an asset with negative returns. We are working on embedding a simple climate emulator into `EZClimate`, as well as updating each of its components to be in line with the sixth assessment report released by the IPCC.
