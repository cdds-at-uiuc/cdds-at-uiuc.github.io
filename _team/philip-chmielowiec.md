## Bio
Philip is a 4th year undergraduate in the department of Electrical and Computer engineering at the University of Illinois. He joined CDDS@UIUC as an undergraduate intern in the summer of 2021 and has remained a member of the group since. His interests are in the intersection of computing and earth science. Whether itâ€™s data science, machine learning, or software engineering, he is interested in the application of computing to scientific research. 

His first project here at CDDS@UIUC was focussed on setting up and analyzing CESM simulations. These simulations were investigating the impact that SST and Sea Ice boundary conditions have on climate sensitivity. He is currently working on his senior capstone project, which is investigating the feasibility of applying transfer learning to sub-seasonal machine learning models. He is using CESM2 reforecast data to improve the accuracy of machine learning models trained on observational data. 

He spent the summer of 2022 at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), participating in their Summer Internship in Parallel Computational Science (SIParCS) program. He worked with the GeoCAT software engineering team to research visualization techniques for unstructured climate data. He also contributed to the UXarray python package. He is continuing his work during the 2022-2021 academic year as an intern. 

Philip was born and raised in Chicago, Illinois. He enjoys learning about and cooking dishes from different cultures. His favorite are Eastern European and Southern European dishes, since he was raised by two Polish parents and grew up in a predominantly Polish and Italian neighborhood. He is also very passionate about music. His main instrument is the Baritone Saxophone which he plays here at the University of Illinois, but also knows how to play the Trombone and Flute. In his free time, he also enjoys biking, hiking, and playing video games.
